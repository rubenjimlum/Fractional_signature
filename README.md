# Fractional signature: a generalisation of the signature inspired by fractional calculus

[[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17446)] (Preprint submitted to Statistics and Probability Letters)

## Content of the repository:
- "fractional_signature_code_1.c": code we have used to compute the discrete fractional signatures in our practical application to machine learning. 
- "fractional_signature_code_2.c": self-contained and isolated code to compute the discrete fractional signature of a piecewise linear path.
- "data_train.csv": training data from the MNIST database of handwritten digits.
- "data_test.csv": test data from the MNIST database of handwritten digits.
- "results_train.csv": file that has been produced using the first code and that contains the computed discrete fractional signatures of the training set.
- "results_test.csv": file that has been produced using the first code and that contains the computed discrete fractional signatures of the test set.

This code uses some mathematical functions from the GNU Scientific Library (GSL) (http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/)
